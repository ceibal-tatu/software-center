= User notes =

The software-center application aims to make the software handling on
the computer easy and consistent.

= Developer notes =

All non UI code must come with tests in the test/ subdirectoy.

To setup your development environment, you'll need to ensure the following
extra packages are installed:

sudo apt-get install xvfb python-coverage python-mock python-aptdaemon.test \
     python-qt4 python-unittest2 python-lxml pep8
sudo apt-get build-dep software-center

You can then run tests with:

cd test;make

You can run a developer instance with:

python setup.py build
./software-center

The initial launch of this will take a bit as it will build a private
search database but this is only needed once.

== query parser ==

The query parser understands :
 "pkg:2vcard", "mime:text/html", "section:web", "origin:main"
prefixes.

== aptdaemon ==
 * the dbus limits for the system bus are rather low, this means that
   adding  <limit name="max_match_rules_per_connection">512</limit>
   and using something bigger than 512 is a good idea

== environment ==
