The testsuite is automatically run on the any a server that is
responsible for running the DEP8 enabled testsuites for the
debian packages.

== Running locally ==

To test locally in a local VM:

Build a VM that the tests can be run inside:
$ bzr co lp:auto-package-testing
$ cd auto-package-testing/bin
$ ./prepare-testbed -r quantal i386
[downloads 200mb data and takes a long time to finish]
$ ./run-adt-test software-center

Login into the VM once and remove cloud-init to prevent
delay on startup.

Or login into the VM itself:
$ kvm -snapshot -m 1024 /tmp/adt/disks/pristine-quantal-i386.img
[wait a long time, login as ubuntu/ubuntu]
$ bzr co lp:software-center
# adt-run --built-tree=. --- adt-virt-null
